# Terra

_Virtual environment for FOSS geo tools_

Terra lets you quickly get up and running with a server loaded with tons of useful open source geospatial tools - to get all the complexity of installation and configuration out of the way. Particularly useful for users wanting cool geo tools, but on _Windows_.

## Software

The box includes the following software tools ready to go:

* Ubuntu 12.04 Precise (x64)
* GDAL
* GEOS
* Proj
* SpatiaLite
* Mapnik
* PostgreSQL
* PostGIS
* Ruby
* Python

## Getting Started

Terra is designed to use [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) to quickly provision a local virtual machine. Combined with [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) automation tools, you can be up and running with a full suite in minutes.

First you need to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), then download and install [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) for your platform.
